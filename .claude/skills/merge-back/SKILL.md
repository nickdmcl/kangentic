# Merge Back

Safely commit, rebase, and push changes. Works from both worktrees and the main repo.

**Usage:** `/merge-back [commit message]`

- `/merge-back` — auto-generates a commit message from the diff
- `/merge-back added new e2e tests` — uses the provided text as the commit message

**User-provided commit message (if any):** $ARGUMENTS

## Pre-flight Checks

All git commands below run from the **current working directory** — never use `cd <path> && git ...` (triggers an unbypasable security prompt). The only exception is Step 6 which uses `git -C <projectRoot>` to target the main repo.

1. **Detect mode:**
   - If CWD contains `.kangentic/worktrees/` → **worktree mode**
   - Otherwise → **main repo mode**
2. Get the current branch name: `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`
   - If `HEAD` (detached) → warn the user and stop.
3. **Worktree mode only:** Derive the project root by walking up from the worktree path — the project root is two directories above `.kangentic/worktrees/<slug>/` (i.e., strip `.kangentic/worktrees/<slug>` from the worktree path).
4. Determine the source branch:
   - **Worktree mode:** `git config kangentic.baseBranch` (fallback: `main`)
   - **Main repo mode:** same as the current branch (push to own remote tracking branch)
5. Run `git status --porcelain` to check for uncommitted changes.

Report the mode, branch name, source branch, and working tree status before proceeding.

## Step 0 — Type Check

Run `npm run typecheck`. If it fails, report the type errors and stop — do not proceed with the merge. Type errors must be fixed before merging back.

## Step 1 — Commit Changes

If there are uncommitted changes (non-empty `git status --porcelain` output):

1. Show the user `git status` and `git diff --stat` for a summary of changes.
2. **Determine the commit message:**
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` is non-empty:
     - Check if it already starts with a conventional commit prefix (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `style:`, `perf:`, `ci:`, `build:`, or any of these with `!` before the colon).
     - If it does, use it as-is.
     - If it does not, analyze the diff to determine the appropriate type prefix and prepend it. For example: `/merge-back added dark mode` becomes `feat: added dark mode`.
   - If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty:
     - Read the full diff (`git diff`), draft a concise commit message.
     - The message **MUST** use conventional commit format.
     - Determine the primary change type from the diff:
       - `feat:` -- new features or capabilities
       - `fix:` -- bug fixes
       - `refactor:` -- restructuring without behavior change
       - `chore:` -- maintenance (deps, config, tooling)
       - `docs:` -- documentation-only changes
       - `test:` -- test-only changes
       - `style:` -- formatting-only changes
       - `perf:` -- performance improvements
       - `ci:` -- CI/CD changes
       - `build:` -- build system changes
     - If the change is breaking, add `!` after the type (e.g., `feat!:`)
     - Scope is optional but encouraged for multi-area changes (e.g., `feat(pty):`, `fix(db):`)
3. **Update documentation before staging** — targeted anchor check (do NOT invoke `/update-docs` as a skill call):
   a. Identify changed source files (exclude `docs/`, `.claude/`, `tests/`).
   b. If no source files changed, skip to step 4.
   c. Check if any changed file is an anchor source (see `.claude/skills/docs-maintenance/SKILL.md` Anchor Points):
      - `src/shared/types.ts`, `src/shared/ipc-channels.ts`, `src/main/db/migrations.ts`
      - `src/renderer/components/settings/AppSettingsPanel.tsx`, `src/renderer/components/settings/settings-registry.ts`
      - `src/shared/template-vars.ts`
   d. If anchor source files changed: spawn a `doc-auditor` agent with those files.
   e. If the agent reports gaps, fix them inline using the `Edit` tool.
   f. No general prose review here (that is `/update-docs`'s job).
4. Stage changes: `git add -A`
5. Write the commit message using the **Write tool** to the relative path `.kangentic/COMMIT_MSG.tmp` (resolved from CWD — do NOT resolve an absolute path, do NOT use the system temp directory, do NOT use `os.tmpdir()`).

   `.kangentic/` is gitignored, so `git add -A` won't stage it and no cleanup is needed.
   Then commit: `git commit -F .kangentic/COMMIT_MSG.tmp`
   **Never write to `.git/`** — in worktrees `.git` is a file, not a directory.
   **Never use `$(...)` or backtick command substitution** — triggers a safety prompt.

If the working tree is clean, skip to Step 2.

## Step 2 — Fetch Latest Source Branch

Run: `git fetch origin <sourceBranch>`

Report if the fetch succeeded or if there were errors (e.g., no remote, authentication failure).

## Step 3 — Rebase onto Source Branch

Run: `git rebase origin/<sourceBranch>`

**If the rebase succeeds** — proceed to Step 4.

**If conflicts occur:**

1. Show the conflicting files using `git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U`
2. Ask the user which approach they prefer:
   - **Resolve conflicts** — open each conflicting file, edit the conflict markers, then `git add <file>` and `git rebase --continue`
   - **Abort and merge instead** — `git rebase --abort` then `git merge origin/<sourceBranch>` (creates a merge commit)
   - **Abort entirely** — `git rebase --abort` and stop the merge-back process
3. If resolving conflicts: read each conflicting file, use `Edit` to resolve the conflict markers, stage the file, and continue the rebase. Repeat until all conflicts are resolved.

## Step 4 — Push to Source Branch

**Worktree mode:** Push to the **source branch** (e.g., `main`), NOT the worktree branch name. The worktree branch is a local working branch only. The goal is to land commits directly on the source branch.

Run: `git push origin HEAD:<sourceBranch>`

This pushes the rebased commits directly to the remote source branch. After a successful rebase, this is guaranteed to be a fast-forward push.

**If the push fails** (e.g., someone else pushed in the meantime):

1. Report the error clearly.
2. Suggest re-running `/merge-back` to fetch the latest and rebase again.
3. Stop — do not force-push.

## Step 5 — Report

Summarize:
- Mode (worktree or main repo)
- Branch name that was merged
- Source branch that received the changes
- Number of commits landed (from `git log origin/<sourceBranch>@{1}..origin/<sourceBranch> --oneline` or similar)
- **Worktree mode only:** Remind the user they can clean up the worktree by moving the task to Done on the board (which triggers `cleanup_worktree`) or manually

## Step 6 — Update Local Source Branch (worktree mode only, always runs after Step 5)

**Skip this step entirely in main repo mode** — you're already on the branch.

The project root (determined in pre-flight step 3) always has the source branch checked out. Run `git -C <projectRoot> pull --ff-only` to fast-forward it to match the remote.

If this fails (e.g., non-fast-forward divergence), report the warning but do not treat it as a fatal error — the remote is already updated.

## Rules

**CRITICAL: No chained commands.** Every Bash call must contain exactly ONE command. Never use `&&`, `||`, `|`, or `;`. For git commands in another directory, use `git -C <path>` — never `cd <path> && git ...`.
