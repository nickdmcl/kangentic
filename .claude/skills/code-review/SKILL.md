# Code Review

Review the current git changes (staged and unstaged) for quality, correctness, and project conventions.

## Instructions

All commands below run from the **current working directory** — never use `cd <path> && git ...` (triggers an unbypasable security prompt). If the CWD is a worktree, git operates on it automatically.

1. Run `npm run typecheck` to check for type errors. Any type errors are **highest-priority findings** — they represent potential runtime crashes. Include them in the review output even if they are in files not touched by the current diff.
2. Run `git diff` and `git diff --staged` to identify all changed files and hunks.
3. For each changed file, read the full file to understand the surrounding context.
4. Analyze every change against the criteria below.
5. Output a structured review grouped by file, with `file:line` references for each finding.

## Review Criteria

### Correctness
- Logic errors, off-by-one mistakes, null/undefined risks
- Missing error handling or unhandled promise rejections
- Race conditions or incorrect async/await usage

### Performance
- Unnecessary allocations, re-renders, or repeated work
- Missing memoization where expensive computation occurs
- Inefficient data structures or algorithms

### Maintainability
- Readability: unclear naming, overly complex expressions
- Duplication that should be extracted
- Premature abstractions or over-engineering

### Best Practices
- TypeScript strict mode compliance — **no `any` in new code**. Use proper types from `src/shared/types.ts`, `unknown` with type guards, or generic constraints. Flag any new `any` or `as any` cast as a finding.
- **No shorthand variable names** in new or changed code. Use full, descriptive names: `session` not `sess`, `currentIndex` not `curIdx`, `previousValue` not `prev`. Applies to variables, parameters, callback args, refs.
- Security: injection risks, unsanitized input
- Proper error handling at system boundaries

### Project Conventions (from CLAUDE.md)
- Single-command bash calls only (no `&&`, `||`, `|`, `;` chaining)
- Lucide React icons only (no inline SVGs)
- `data-testid` and `data-swimlane-name` attributes for test selectors
- Zustand stores with IPC bridge pattern
- IPC channels defined in `src/shared/ipc-channels.ts`
- All dialogs use global `useEffect` Escape key listener

### Domain-Specific Checks

After identifying changed files in Step 2, read the relevant skill files to load domain context. Then apply the domain-specific checks below in addition to the general criteria.

**IPC files** (`ipc-channels.ts`, `types.ts`, `preload.ts`, `handlers/`, `mock-electron-api.js`):
- Read `.claude/skills/ipc-bridge/SKILL.md` before reviewing these changes
- Verify all 7 IPC layers are consistent: channel constant, types, preload, handler, service, store, mock
- Check push event subscriptions return unsubscribe functions
- Check push event callbacks filter by `projectId`
- Check `!mainWindow.isDestroyed()` guard on broadcasts

**Session/PTY/terminal files** (`session-manager.ts`, `session-queue.ts`, `transition-engine.ts`, `tasks.ts` handleTaskMove, `session-store.ts`, `TerminalPanel.tsx`):
- Read `.claude/skills/session-lifecycle/SKILL.md` before reviewing these changes
- Verify state transitions follow the legal state machine
- Check `commandInjector.cancel()` is called before session state changes in handleTaskMove
- Check generation counter / reference comparison guards are preserved
- Check terminal ownership handoff: one xterm per session, `dialogSessionId` exclusion
- Check `status` is not overwritten after suspend (exit handler must check current status)

**Shell/agent/path files** (`shell-resolver.ts`, `command-builder.ts`, `worktree-manager.ts`, `paths.ts`, `useTerminal.ts`):
- Read `.claude/skills/cross-platform/SKILL.md` before reviewing these changes
- Check for Unicode em-dashes (must use ASCII `--`)
- Check PowerShell quoting: prompts replace `"` with `'` before `quoteArg()`
- Check Windows file ops use `{ force: true }` on `rmSync`
- Check `git -C <path>` instead of `cd && git`
- Check xterm WebGL context loss handling
- Check PTY resize debouncing is preserved

## Output Format

### Findings Table

Present all findings in a single table, sorted by severity (Critical first, then High, Medium, Low):

| # | Severity | Category | Location | Finding | Recommendation |
|---|----------|----------|----------|---------|----------------|
| 1 | Critical | Correctness | `src/main/foo.ts:42` | Brief description of the issue | **Must fix** — what to change and why |
| 2 | High | Best Practices | `src/renderer/Bar.tsx:15` | Brief description | **Should fix** — suggested change |
| 3 | Medium | Performance | `src/main/baz.ts:88` | Brief description | **Consider** — tradeoff explanation |
| 4 | Low | Maintainability | `src/shared/types.ts:10` | Brief description | **Optional** — nice-to-have improvement |

#### Severity levels

| Severity | Meaning | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Critical** | Type errors, runtime crashes, data loss, security vulnerabilities | **Must fix** before merging |
| **High** | Logic bugs, missing error handling, `any` types, race conditions | **Should fix** — real risk of breakage |
| **Medium** | Performance issues, convention violations, unclear code | **Consider** — improves quality but not blocking |
| **Low** | Style nits, minor duplication, optional improvements | **Optional** — fix if touching the area anyway |

### Summary

End with:
- **Files reviewed:** N
- **Findings:** N critical, N high, N medium, N low
- **Verdict:** one of:
  - **Ship it** — no findings, or only low-severity items
  - **Minor issues** — medium findings worth addressing, no blockers
  - **Needs revision** — critical or high-severity findings that should be resolved

## Allowed Tools

Only use `Read` and `Bash` (for git commands) during this review. Always run commands from the project root directory — no chained commands (`&&`, `||`, `|`, `;`).

**CRITICAL: Use `git -C <path>` for all git commands in other directories.** Never use `cd <path> && git ...` — the `cd && git` pattern triggers an unbypasable Claude Code security prompt.
