# Merge Back

Safely commit, rebase, and push changes. Works from both worktrees and the main repo.

**Usage:** `/merge-back [commit message]`

- `/merge-back` — auto-generates a commit message from the diff
- `/merge-back added new e2e tests` — uses the provided text as the commit message

## Pre-flight Checks

All git commands below run from the **current working directory** — never use `cd <path> && git ...` (triggers an unbypasable security prompt). The only exception is Step 6 which uses `git -C <projectRoot>` to target the main repo.

1. **Detect mode:**
   - If CWD contains `.kangentic/worktrees/` → **worktree mode**
   - Otherwise → **main repo mode**
2. Get the current branch name: `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`
   - If `HEAD` (detached) → warn the user and stop.
3. **Worktree mode only:** Derive the project root by walking up from the worktree path — the project root is two directories above `.kangentic/worktrees/<slug>/` (i.e., strip `.kangentic/worktrees/<slug>` from the worktree path).
4. Determine the source branch:
   - **Worktree mode:** `git config kangentic.baseBranch` (fallback: `main`)
   - **Main repo mode:** same as the current branch (push to own remote tracking branch)
5. Run `git status --porcelain` to check for uncommitted changes.

Report the mode, branch name, source branch, and working tree status before proceeding.

## Step 0 — Type Check

Run `npm run typecheck`. If it fails, report the type errors and stop — do not proceed with the merge. Type errors must be fixed before merging back.

## Step 1 — Commit Changes

If there are uncommitted changes (non-empty `git status --porcelain` output):

1. Show the user `git status` and `git diff --stat` for a summary of changes.
2. If the user provided a commit message with the command (e.g., `/merge-back added new e2e tests`), use that text as the commit message.
3. Otherwise, read the full diff (`git diff`), draft a concise commit message summarizing the changes.
4. Stage changes: `git add -A`
5. Write the commit message to `COMMIT_MSG.tmp` in CWD using the **Write tool**.
   **Important:** Write the file AFTER `git add -A` so it is not staged.
   Then commit: `git commit -F COMMIT_MSG.tmp`
   Then clean up: `rm COMMIT_MSG.tmp`
   **Never write to `.git/`** — in worktrees `.git` is a file, not a directory.
   **Never use `$(...)` or backtick command substitution** — triggers a safety prompt.

If the working tree is clean, skip to Step 2.

## Step 2 — Fetch Latest Source Branch

Run: `git fetch origin <sourceBranch>`

Report if the fetch succeeded or if there were errors (e.g., no remote, authentication failure).

## Step 3 — Rebase onto Source Branch

Run: `git rebase origin/<sourceBranch>`

**If the rebase succeeds** — proceed to Step 4.

**If conflicts occur:**

1. Show the conflicting files using `git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U`
2. Ask the user which approach they prefer:
   - **Resolve conflicts** — open each conflicting file, edit the conflict markers, then `git add <file>` and `git rebase --continue`
   - **Abort and merge instead** — `git rebase --abort` then `git merge origin/<sourceBranch>` (creates a merge commit)
   - **Abort entirely** — `git rebase --abort` and stop the merge-back process
3. If resolving conflicts: read each conflicting file, use `Edit` to resolve the conflict markers, stage the file, and continue the rebase. Repeat until all conflicts are resolved.

## Step 4 — Push to Source Branch

Run: `git push origin HEAD:<sourceBranch>`

This pushes the rebased commits directly to the remote source branch. After a successful rebase, this is guaranteed to be a fast-forward push.

**If the push fails** (e.g., someone else pushed in the meantime):

1. Report the error clearly.
2. Suggest re-running `/merge-back` to fetch the latest and rebase again.
3. Stop — do not force-push.

## Step 5 — Report

Summarize:
- Mode (worktree or main repo)
- Branch name that was merged
- Source branch that received the changes
- Number of commits landed (from `git log origin/<sourceBranch>@{1}..origin/<sourceBranch> --oneline` or similar)
- **Worktree mode only:** Remind the user they can clean up the worktree by moving the task to Done on the board (which triggers `cleanup_worktree`) or manually

## Step 6 — Update Local Source Branch (worktree mode only)

**Skip this step entirely in main repo mode** — you're already on the branch.

The project root (determined in pre-flight step 3) always has the source branch checked out. Run `git -C <projectRoot> pull --ff-only` to fast-forward it to match the remote.

If this fails (e.g., non-fast-forward divergence), report the warning but do not treat it as a fatal error — the remote is already updated.

## Allowed Tools

Use `Read`, `Glob`, `Grep`, `Bash` (for `git` and `npm` commands), `Write` (for commit message temp files), `Edit` (for conflict resolution), and `AskUserQuestion`.

**CRITICAL: No chained commands.** Every Bash call must contain exactly ONE command. Never use `&&`, `||`, `|`, or `;`. For git commands in another directory, use `git -C <path>` — never `cd <path> && git ...`.
